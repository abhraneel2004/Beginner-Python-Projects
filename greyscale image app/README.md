This project is a Python-based tool that converts images into ASCII art using the Pillow library. ASCII art is a technique that represents images through characters and symbols from the ASCII character set. This tool can be used to add a creative touch to your images or to simply explore the concept of ASCII art.

2. Install the Pillow library using pip:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abhraneel2004/Beginner-Python-Projects.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 'greyscale image app\pythonProject\'
   ```

2. Run the script with the desired image file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   Replace `your_image.jpg` with the path to the image file you want to convert.

3. Follow the prompts to customize the conversion settings such as ASCII character set, color mode, and output file.
