# Beginner Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly python projects that you can use to learn and practice your python skills. Each project has a description, a list of requirements, and a solution file. You can also test your code using the provided test cases.

## Why this repository? 🤔

Python is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. It is used for web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. Learning python can open up many opportunities for you as a developer and a learner.

However, learning python can also be challenging, especially if you are new to programming or have no guidance. That is why this repository exists: to provide you with fun and engaging python projects that will help you learn the basics of python and improve your coding skills.

## How to use this repository? 🚀

To use this repository, you need to have python installed on your computer. You can download and install python from [here]. You also need a code editor or an IDE to write and run your code. Some popular choices are [Visual Studio Code], [PyCharm], and [Sublime Text].

To get started, you can clone or download this repository to your local machine. Then, you can browse through the projects folder and choose a project that interests you. Each project has a README file that explains the project goal, the requirements, and the expected output. You can also see the solution file if you get stuck or want to compare your code.

To run your code, you can use the terminal or the command prompt and navigate to the project folder. Then, you can type `python <filename>.py` to execute your code. For example, if you want to run the project `guess_the_number.py`, you can type `python guess_the_number.py`.

You can also use the test cases provided in the test folder to check your code for errors and bugs. To run the test cases, you need to install pytest, a python testing framework.
