# Rock Paper Scissors Game üéÆ

This is a simple and fun game of rock paper scissors made with Python and Tkinter. You can play against the computer and see who wins. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Are you ready to challenge the computer? üòé

## Installation and Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To play this game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the Tkinter library, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. You can install Tkinter by typing `pip install tkinter` in the terminal or the command prompt.

To run the game, you can clone or download this repository to your local machine. Then, you can navigate to the project folder and type `python main.py` to start the game. Alternatively, you can open the project folder in your code editor or IDE and run the file from there.

## How the Game Works üé≤

The game has a simple and user-friendly interface made with Tkinter. You can see five buttons at the bottom of the window, representing the five possible choices: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock. You can click on any of these buttons to make your move.

The computer will also make a random move and display it on the right side of the window. The result of the game will be shown on the top of the window, indicating whether you won, lost, or drew the game. You can also see the score of both players at the bottom right corner of the window.

The game follows the rules of the classic rock paper scissors game, with two additional choices: lizard and spock. The rules are as follows:

- Rock crushes scissors and lizard
- Paper covers rock and disproves spock
- Scissors cuts paper and decapitates lizard
- Lizard poisons spock and eats paper
- Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock

If both players choose the same move, the game is a draw.

## Acknowledgements üôè

I would like to thank [Educative] for their awesome tutorial on how to build a rock paper scissors game with Python and Tkinter. I learned a lot from their article and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about GUI development with Python.
